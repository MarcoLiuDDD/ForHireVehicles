Outline of Design:

1. Create an AWS Lambda function to pull data from the website API every day/hour as needed (python code of Lambda in "lambda.py").

2. Use a S3 bucket as the storage place for the pulled data. Each pull of data is in a new partition/folder.

3. Use AWS Glue to catalog the data in S3.

4. Use Athena to run SQL query to query the data in S3 and find out what we need, see "questions_and_answers" file for sample SQL queries.
